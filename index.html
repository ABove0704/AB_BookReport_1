		<p style="font-size:15px; color:black;"> Steve Case brought AOL to the World Wide Web. Case wanted to have a new online service for users to have multiple opinions of webbing, checking e-mails, and even playing games on their websites. AOL brought millions of users the opinion to check e-mails from other users. This concept made it easier for users to send messages through the web rather than sending people a letter that will take days or weeks to receive. This new invention made communication earlier for people trying to send a message out as quickly as possible. <p>

		<p style="font-size:15px; color:black;"> AOL had many opinions on their website for users to use as e-mail, play games, live online communication, and even chat in private and public chatrooms. This is the time when people started to get catfish from talking to people virtually because the users couldnâ€™t see the other users' faces. The catfish would use a fake photo of them to make the users think they look like the photo online. <p>

		<p style="font-size:15px; color:black;"> AOL made members pay for online phone calls and by the end of 1990, users were paying a monthly fee to use all of AOL services like messaging, talking, and webbing. AOL transitions to the online world made it earlier for users to access the web. <p>
